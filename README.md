NsbPresentation2014
===================

Presentation on NSB and how we use EDA at Pro Teck.

Trying to use [Impress.js](https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js) for the slides. Also brought to you by Node and Express 4.

At [Pro Teck](www.proteckservices.com), we have some great things going for us, but we also have some significant problems to solve, including a monolithic legacy code base. This is the story of how we started building our architecture for the future as a service-oriented, event-driven architecture using asynchronous messaging. 

The technology that enables that architectural style on our .NET stack is [NServiceBus](http://particular.net/nservicebus). This presentation explains why we love it.
