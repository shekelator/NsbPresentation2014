Notes:

1) Who's familiar with these:
	- NServiceBus
	- EDA
	- SOA
	- Pub/sub

2) Who has worked on significantly-sized monolithic system?
	- Tried to make it better? How?



Service autonomy:
	- Think of Pro Teck, accepting orders
	- It's easy to add components that react to business events
	- Also auditing, tracking are easy
	- Monitoring a distributed, decoupled system is difficult, but pub/sub makes it easier

	- Conway's Law: organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations
	- Services are people, too! SOA isn't just about organizing software, but organizing business capabilities, including the organizations/departments the support those capabilities. Ideally a "service" supports and is supported by a group of people.
